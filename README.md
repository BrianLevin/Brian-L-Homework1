# HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

 
 ## Description

 For this assignment, we had to take preexisting code from a mock marketing website and refractor the Html and CSS. I had to ensure   that all links were functioning correctly and  to clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organize them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each element or section of the page.
